# pyECB_gmaxwell
A Python wrapper based on the pyECB extention (by Denis von Arx, @dvarx)

## Instructions on how to use this package:
After cloning this repository follow these steps (this is for Windows, but it shouldn't differ too much on Linux/Unix).
* **Create a virtual environment:**
1. open your current working directory in the command line/terminal (I would recommend using _this_ folder, i.e. `.\pyECB_gmaxwell\`)
2. type `virtualenv --version` and ensure that this package is installed
  (2a. if not, install it by typing `pip install virtualenv`)
3. use the command `python -m venv [environment]`, replace [environment] with any name you like
4. activate the virtual environment by typing `[environment]\Scripts\activate`
5. make sure you have the latest vesion of pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
6. install required packages using `pip install ...`: `numpy, pyserial, pythonnet, matplotlib, pandas, pyUSB, python-usbtmc, pyVISA`

* **Prepare devices for use (Windows):**
1. follow the instructions in `.\pyECB_original\README.md` (within your virtual environment!!)
2. If using the calibration cube: See the files `serial_reader.py` and `calibrate_cube.py`
3. If using the Metrolab sensor: Plug in the device and install `libusb-win32` driver using [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/).
4. When done using the Metrolab sensor: reinstall the VISA USB driver following [these](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z0000019La2SAE&l=en-US) instructions.

## Notes:
If you are using an IDE, make sure to choose the `python.exe` file in your virtual environment as an interpreter!

This code was used for the ECB-820. A new power supply will probably be used, so this may become obsolete.
